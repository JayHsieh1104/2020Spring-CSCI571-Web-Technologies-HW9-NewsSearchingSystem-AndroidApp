USC CSCI571 Web Technologies HW9 - News Searching System (Spring 2020)

The project is the Android application version of the HW8. It aims to construct a news aggregator to display top headlines for both the New York Times and the Guardian News on Android platforms.

Based on the selection by the user, the top-headlines should be for any of the following domains – world, politics, business, technology, and sports. Each such article can be shared by the user on Facebook, Twitter ,or via Email.

For each article, after expanding, the user can even add comments on the articles if they like. Also, the user can search for any keyword to read articles about any topic of his/her choice with autosuggestions available for his/her search query.
